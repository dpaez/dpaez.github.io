## About

::: card-content
Hi, I'm Diego also known as `DEKA | DK` (he/him). Class '85. Natural from Tierra del Fuego, Patagonia, Argentina.  

I have a Licentiate's Degree in Computer Science from the National University of La Plata, UNLP - Informática.  

In 2018, I co-founded [GEUT](https://geutstudio.com), an exclusive software consultancy company and a Lab for P2P projects.
A few years later in Q4 2020, started [SHER](https://sher.geutstudio.com). GEUT's flagship P2P product. You can read more about it [here](https://sher.geutstudio.com/blog/mission/).

> Always looking to mix ideas, like an alchemist for thoughts. 

My current goal is around learning & shaping the business-side of [SHER](https://sher.geutstudio.com), _the decentralized live audio platform._

___

Some of my previous experience includes, working on companies like Despegar and Labs like LIFIA. In Despegar my role was `Fullstack Engineer`. One of the projects where I play a part was about creating something like _components as a service_. Those were rendered and consumed by different teams.  

I've also spent some time working as an `Assistant Professor` at my _alma mater_. The subjects where about "User Centered Design" and "Mobile Devices' Interfaces". I was on charge of some lectures and preparing practical exercises. This was a fantastic experience, hopefully I might repeat it someday.
